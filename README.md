## Motivation
All throughout middle school and high school I was a pretty good english student, but ever since I started college I began to lose confidence over my pronounciation and I found it really frustrating because 99.9% of my online time is in in english, and that's a humongous part of my time. So the goal of this extension is to better my spoken english.

## Installation

### Firefox

You can download the extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/double-click-pronounce/).

### Chrome

I find it really enfuriating that you need to pay to submit an extension to chrome's store, so the steps are:
  - download the zip [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/double-click-pronounce/)
  - uncompress it
  - open chrome
  - Go to Settings > Extensions > Load unpacked
  - Enjoy!
