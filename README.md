# Double-click pronounce: improve your pronounciation for any language üó£

Never doubt how to pronounce a word. Double-click it and your browser will read it out loud for you! (Works on Firefox and Chrome).

Some people use double click to select a word and to then expand the selection to other words, as it would be terrible for you to listen to any selection out loud, double click pronounce will only read out loud when you double-click a single word.

## Motivation
All throughout middle school and high school I was a pretty good english student, but ever since I started college I began to lose confidence over my pronounciation and I found it really frustrating because 99.9% of my online time is in in english, and that's a huge part of my time. So the goal of this extension is to improve my spoken english.

## Installation

### Firefox

You can download the extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/double-click-pronounce/).

### Chrome

I find it really enfuriating that you need to pay to submit an extension to chrome's store, so the steps are:
  - Download the zip [here](https://github.com/filipeisho/pronounce/releases/latest)
  - Uncompress it
  - Open chrome
  - Go to Settings > Extensions > Load unpacked
  - Enjoy!
  
Alternatively consider installing another browser, maybe [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)? üòè
